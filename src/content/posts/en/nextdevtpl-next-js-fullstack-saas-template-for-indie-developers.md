Happy New Year! I recently turned a template I kept refining across multiple projects into an open-source project: **NextDevTpl**. The goal is simple: **don’t waste time on non-core business work**.

## Why build this template?

If you have built products from 0 to 1 before, you probably know this already: the most time-consuming part is often not the business logic itself, but repeatedly rebuilding infrastructure.

- Login, registration, permissions, and session management
- Subscription payments, webhooks, and billing status sync
- Credits deduction/issuance, expiration, and transaction records
- Email notifications, file uploads, and support tickets
- Admin dashboard, logging/monitoring, and error alerts

You rebuild these every time. It’s not just time-consuming — it also increases the chance of hidden issues surfacing after launch.

So I extracted these high-frequency modules into a reusable template, aiming for out-of-the-box usability with long-term extensibility.

## Tech stack (current version)

- **Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 4 + Shadcn/UI**
- **Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL**
- **Better Auth (account system)**
- **next-intl (i18n)**
- **S3/R2-compatible object storage**
- **Vitest + Biome engineering support**

## Built-in capabilities (not just a shell)

### 1) Users and permissions

- Email sign-up/sign-in and OAuth
- Session management and role isolation (`user` / `admin`)

### 2) Monetization capabilities

- Subscription payment flow
- Webhook processing
- Credits ledger and charging logic

### 3) Operations support

- Email templates and delivery
- File upload and management
- Ticket system (user side + admin side)
- Admin console (user management + data dashboard)

### 4) Engineering safeguards

- API rate limiting (optional)
- Structured logging (optional)
- Error monitoring (optional)
- Automatic graceful degradation when external services are not configured (great for local development and debugging)

## Who is this for?

- Indie developers who want to launch an MVP quickly
- Small teams that want a unified technical foundation
- Developers who are tired of rebuilding auth, payment, and admin panels for every new project

## Quick start

```plain text
git clone git@github.com:evepupil/NextDevTpl.git
cd NextDevTpl
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm db:push
pnpm dev
```

## What problem am I trying to solve?

The core goal of this project is not to “stack buzzwords,” but to help you spend your time on what truly matters:

1. Business loop and core value
2. User feedback and iteration speed
3. Monetization validation and growth

## Feedback and collaboration welcome

If you’d like to try it, I’d love real feedback:

Which modules matter most to you?  
What still isn’t production-ready enough?  
What capabilities should be prioritized next?

Issues and PRs are welcome — let’s polish this into a truly production-grade, practical template. Feel free to discuss ideas on linux.do as well; I’ll keep iterating.

Haha, I’ve also used this template in the past two weeks to launch two overseas projects quickly. If you’re into indie hacking, feel free to connect.
