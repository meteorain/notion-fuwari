Vercel projects can be slow on some domestic networks, and sometimes Vercel routing itself is unstable. A practical fix is **Cloudflare reverse proxy + preferred nodes**.

Preparation:

1. A Vercel project to proxy and its domain
2. A Cloudflare account

Note: in the following, assume users access accelerated domain `B.xxx.com`, while Vercel is currently bound to `A.xxx.com` (non-accelerated).

## Cloudflare reverse proxy

I already covered details here: [Cloudflare Worker反向代理网站教程 - 潮思Chaosyn](https://blog.chaosyn.com/posts/cloudflare-worker%E5%8F%8D%E5%90%91%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/)

Simplified steps:

1. Fork or build your own reverse-proxy script: [https://github.com/evepupil/any-proxy](https://github.com/evepupil/any-proxy)
2. Replace target domain in the proxy code with your own site. For Vercel, bind `A.xxx.com` in the Vercel project and proxy that domain.

1. Create an application in Cloudflare and select your forked repo.

1. Wait until deployment succeeds.
2. Add an interception route in Worker settings so all `B.xxx.com/*` traffic is routed through this Worker.

## Cloudflare preferred nodes

Detailed guide is here: [https://blog.chaosyn.com/posts/cloud-flare配置优选节点教程/](https://blog.chaosyn.com/posts/cloud-flare%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E4%BC%98%E9%80%89%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/)

Simplified steps:

1. Add a CNAME record in Cloudflare DNS and point it to any preferred node.

1. Done. Traffic to `B.xxx.com` now benefits from preferred-node acceleration.
